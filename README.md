## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   A local web server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or WAMP.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Move to your web server directory:**
    -   Place the cloned project folder inside the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or `www` (for WAMP).

3.  **Database Setup:**
    -   Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services from your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
    -   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    -   Create a new database. You can name it `lms_db` or any other name.
    -   Select the newly created database and click on the **Import** tab.
    -   Choose the `lms.sql` file from the project directory and click **Go** to import the schema and data.

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    -   Open the file `includes/config.php`.
    -   Update the database connection details with your credentials:
        ```php
        $db_host = 'localhost';
        $db_name = 'your_database_name'; // e.g., 'lms_db'
        $db_user = 'root';
        $db_pass = ''; // your database password, usually empty for default XAMPP
        ```

5.  **Create Initial Users (Optional):**
    -   The `admin` table holds user credentials for all roles.
    -   You can manually add users via `phpMyAdmin` or use the provided `create_user.php` script.
    -   To use the script, open it, modify the `$email`, `$password`, and `$designation` variables, and then run it by navigating to `http://localhost/your-project-folder/create_user.php` in your browser.

6.  **Run the Application:**
